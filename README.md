This is a demonstration on the mobile first approach application:



1)  When developing mobile layout first and tablet and desktop afterward, 
    you get a better final result. 

2) Constraints of the mobile screen are solved at the beginning of the development 
    and can be quickly put aside allowing focus to shift to desktop and tablet.


3)  ###  Optimization
    Loading the bare minimum layouts and elements onto the screens first for mobiles
    instead of heavy ones for desktop layouts means loading times are faster.

    Therefore large sized images and other more complex content load more slowly on a desktop.
    
4)  ### Summary
    The mobile-first approach means the bare minimum is loaded first. 
    Anything else loaded is extra. The start is small but increases along with the viewport.
